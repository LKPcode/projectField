## The Field Project
*A short Description for every root folder:*

 - **django_project_ktima:**  is the main folder of the django application. It contains mostly settings and a bit of routing logic.
 - **main_app:**  is where the API logic is being formed and database models are being created.
 - **serve_web_app:** is the logic that will serve our lovely VueJS application to the client.
 - **ktima_vue:** is the folder where the Vue application is being developed.
 - **testing:** is a folder to test whatever we want.  More like a basket.

>The Voyage to the destination is why we started in the first place
